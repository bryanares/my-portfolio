            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>A Software Development student with a passion for technology and programming, which led me to join Moringa School.
               In early 2018, I happened upon a friend who was working on his computer science project and I immediately fell in love with programming.
               I aim to become a full-stack software developer with a specialty in back-end development.
               Highly inquisitive and curious, I enjoy working and collaborating in teams in order to learn from my peers as well as pass on my knowledge to others.
    
            </p>
            <p>
               In my free time I enjoy a good book, watching Anime (Massive fan) and gaming when indoors. I also love outdoors activities such as swimming,
               taking walks and bike riding.

                <h4>Avecar Kenya Limited</h4>
                <p>
                    This is a contractor website that I have been working on while learning in my first week of Moringa school.
                    It contains some project photos and has links to 3 pages. It incorporates various css and html concepts.
                    <br>
                    <a href="#">View site..</a>
                </p>
                <h4>CSS Demo Cheatsheet</h4>
                <p>
                    This is a custom web page made using html and css for learning purposes. It utilizes all css elements that I learned during Moringa 
                    school week 1.
                    This really helped me to understand various styling elements which I eventually applied in the portfolio.
                    <br>
                    <a href="#">View site..</a>
                </p>
                <h4>My First Website</h4>
          <p>
            This was the first ever website I made in Moringa school. I created it as I was learning html and it really laid a foundation on how
            website structures are developed.
