            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>A Software Development student with a passion for technology and programming, which led me to join Moringa School.
               In early 2018, I happened upon a friend who was working on his computer science project and I immediately fell in love with programming.
               I aim to become a full-stack software developer with a specialty in back-end development.
               Highly inquisitive and curious, I enjoy working and collaborating in teams in order to learn from my peers as well as pass on my knowledge to others.
    
            </p>
            <p>
               In my free time I enjoy a good book, watching Anime (Massive fan) and gaming when indoors. I also love outdoors activities such as swimming,
               taking walks and bike riding.
            </p>
